## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This one has some new things to do in form components and some different than usual challenges to layout cards (literally). 

Allowing specific no. of digits to be entered and limiting the options, verifying and showing error messages accordingly,
also positioning, it is the most difficult images positioning challenge i've done, it took me a while to find the best possible setup i can think of.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
